# 兔子连锁店

## Description

Satori's bunny store was a huge success! She soon accumulated enough money to open up chain stores around SUSTech.

Satori opened up $N$ bunny stores recently. For some unknown reasons, Satori must observe the following rules:

each store opens for only consecutive $W$ days, and
each store can open again after it has closed for at least $H$ days.
Satori also made up a plan for the following $M$ days. In day $i$, exactly $d_i$ stores should be open and store $i$ should open exactly $w_i$ days among all $M$ days. Now she is wondering if she can accomplish her plan without breaking the rules.
